## What are the great books?

The foundational texts of Western civilization. Contemplating the self, society, and God.

## Why do I want to read them?

I had a fantastic European history teacher in high school. One of those teachers you'd create movies like the Dead Poets Society about. Her class was my first exposure to some of the "Great Books": texts like The Prince, Book of the Courtier, Two Treatises of Government, etc. Although I've forgotten the minutae of my European history studies, her lectures impressed upon me an indelible admiration of the Renaissance humanists. Examining what it means to be human, the love of humanity, the love of learning, mastery of mind, body, and soul.

Then I studied engineering in college and floundered. I don't really care about being a shit engineer, but one thing I do deeply regret is not using my collegiate years to study things that I loved. College, that wonderful period of time (at least for me), in which my only responsibility was to learn, was wasted on me.   

Now, I want to learn. I wish I'd had an education in the classics, but just because I'm no longer in school doesn't mean I can't get that education. Now, the real learning can begin.

## Why am I discussing this?

In this sociopolitical climate I actually feel somewhat ashamed to admit that I want to read these books. In my circles there are people who would burn the Western canon and crucify those who want to study it because of the lack of diversity. Yes, I want to read a bunch of books written by ancient white men (and a few women).

I grew up in the United States. I want to know how the West was built and the stories we tell about it. What thoughts prevail today that can be traced back to Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare?

If, in the end, I decide to reject the Great Books, at least I will actually understand what I am rejecting.

## The Plan

I'm going to be reading the books for the next year, up until March 2022, with the Interintellect. Read for a month, then come together and discuss.
