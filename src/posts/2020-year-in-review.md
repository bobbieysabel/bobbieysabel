What a whirlwind of a year. When I look back on 2020, here are the stories I want to remember.

## Stories

#### Travel

I got to travel to Korea at the beginning of the year to attend my nephew's second birthday. My parents and I spent New Year's Eve at the airport waiting for the flight to Seoul.  I'd experienced rejection after rejection in my job hunt in the final quarter of 2019, so the trip was a welcome reprieve from life at the time. During that trip, I'd resolved that this year I'd get my life together, and that return flight Incheon to NYC would be the last time I utterly dread returning to reality. (Little did I know, a pandemic was waiting in the wings).

Korea was beautiful. I loved getting the opportunity to explore a new country with my parents. Despite the turmoil and uncertainty that surrounded this period of my life, I was grateful to spend so much time with them. I know they won't be around together.

#### Relationships

Reached third year with my current boyfriend, in February. It's been a weird few years for us. We'd already been somewhat long distance, only seeing each other once a month. and then COVID hit! But me and him are doing incredible, and I'm grateful for him.

Month before NYC shut down, I had an incredible night with my college friends, a lot of who I haven't seen since graduation, some of who I would like to see more often than I currently get to. For a while I've really been mourning the loss of closeness that we had. It's okay, I mean, that's life and we all have to move on. But it makes me think a lot about friendships. ^^Who will be the friends of this decade? Who will be the friends of the next decade?^^

My uncle died, due to non-COVID related reasons and I felt...nothing really. I'd probably spoken to the man like 5 times in my lifetime, despite seeing him regularly at family events. I felt like a detached observer. I felt loss on behalf of my family who deeply felt his loss. I made the video we played at the funeral services. I thought about how one measures a life.

My grandmother turned 100. We'd originally planned to have a huge party for her, which obviously couldn't happen.

#### Professional

Sometime in April I'd resolved to figure out what the fuck I'm doing with my career. I'd been burnt out from looking for work in the tech world, and I decided that if I didn't come out from this pandemic (which at the time I hadn't thought would last...the rest of the year) I would think of another path. And I didn't really want to think of another path, so I resolved to finally get that job lol.

During the summer I took on some unpaid design work.

Got a product design job. I knew it would feel good, but I was startled at how much it felt like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders. ^^Of course, now it's only a short time before I start thinking about what's next? What do I really want to do?^^

#### Pandemic

Lots of Zoom hangouts with friends, playing Jackbox, watching music festivals together. Moments I enjoyed, but simply don't approximate the real thing. I continue to wonder about friendship and how much I truly have in common with these people who are my friends. ^^How much of it was simply being in the same place at the same time? ^^ (Not passing judgment on that, I'm just curious about the randomness of it all)

## Themes

And if I had to make sense of this insane year, here would be the themes.

Gratitude. I have so much to be grateful for this year.  I am alive and almost everyone I love is alive. I found a product design job and I get to do work I enjoy. I get to work remotely.

Privilege. On the flip side, I am keenly aware, perhaps now more than ever, of the class differences that allow me to stay home and work remotely and get paid well for it, while others die doing essential work. I don't know what to do about it.

Hedonic Treadmill. I felt demoralized during my period of unemployment, then was ecstatic to find a good job, then shortly after returned to a baseline level of happiness and began thinking: what's next? It's not necessarily a bad thing to be looking toward the future and thinking about where I want to take my career, but I am the type of person who gets stuck there. I need to escape the hedonic treadmill and focus on being content with who I am and where I am in the present.

Friendship.

* Stories of this Year, mind jogged by photos

  * I take a few regional trips with my parents, once again just incredibly grateful that I get to spend this time with them. How grateful I am that all three of us are alive.
  * Walks with my father

  * And... I discover Roam, I discover the Interintellect. I start writing a lot more, journaling. I start trying to build a meditation habit and be more mindful. I start reflecting more on the big questions I want to answer in my life. That's currently the theme of my life, I guess. Figuring that out as I revel in my new freedom. What I want to do. Who I want to be.
